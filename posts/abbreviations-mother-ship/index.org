<<mount-drives>>
#+end_src

This tangle is for extra configurations that are meant for PCs with a GUI that a user interacts with directly (as opposed to a server) and it has stuff that aren't going to be used on servers.

I'm putting it in ~dingehaufen/conf.d/~ so it should be linked to in ~.config/fish/conf.d/~ for PCs that need it.

* Mount Drives

This is an abbreviation that mounts both the cryfs folders and the external (LUKs) drive.

#+begin_src fish :noweb-ref mount-drives
abbr --add -- mount-drives "mountcryfs; mount-data"
#+end_src

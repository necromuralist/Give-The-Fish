* The Function

This is a function to check what we have set-up as a hostname for the times that I forget an IP address for a device on the LAN. It checks the hosts file and the ssh-config. The ~hosts~ file has the IP address, but sometimes I can't remember the host-name, just the user-name, in which case checking the SSH config file can sometimes be helpful.

#+begin_src fish :noweb-ref the-function
function hostgrep --argument-names HOST --description "Look for a hostname."
#+end_src

* The Parts
** Check Hosts
First check the ~/etc/hosts~ file.

#+begin_src fish :noweb-ref check-hosts
grep $HOST /etc/hosts
#+end_src

** Check SSH

Now Check the ssh configuration.

#+begin_src fish :noweb-ref check-ssh
grep --after-context 3 $HOST $HOME/.ssh/config
#+end_src

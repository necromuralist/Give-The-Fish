#+TITLE: Give the Fish


This is a repository of fish functions that I'm building and sharing amongst my machines. I've started documenting it [[https://necromuralist.github.io/Give-The-Fish/][on gihtub-pages]].

From Google Translate (English to Latin and back again):

  Fish Functions -> Pisces Munera -> Fish Gifts -> Pisces Dona -> Give the Fish -> Dat Pisces <--> Gives Fish

It seems to settle on "Gives Fish" but I like /Give the Fish/ better.
